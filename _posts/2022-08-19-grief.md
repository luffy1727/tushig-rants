I lost someone. Sudden burst of sorrow takes over my body as I pour my next shot of Jameson.
I wish there was a map for dealing with the loss of those who are still living. 

I don't write because I have something to say. I just write because if I don't everything else will be so much worse.

Ok. So life is short. But i did not know it was this short. Recently I saw an article about quantifying life. I live 5401 km away from home and it is very expensive for me to fly home every year.
