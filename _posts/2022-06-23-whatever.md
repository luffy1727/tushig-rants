I started running in serious distances nowadays. Hardest thing about running in great distances is reserving an sudden burst of energy to sprint in case some hypothetical serial killer starts running after me with murderous intent. 

Life feels kind of flat and slow nowadays. I am not sure if it is a Sweden thing, but my todo lists are not todo lists anymore. It turned into whenever-you-feel-like-try-to-do-it-if-you-want-lists.

I hate the fact that Spotify doesn't auto correct ASAP to A$AP in 2022. Babushka boi has been playing in my mind whole day.
