I don't want you to save me. But you can hold my hand, while I save myself.

I have started running in some serious distances nowadays. Hardest part is reserving a sudden burst of energy to sprint in the case of some hypothetical serial killer starts running after me with murderous intent. 

Some days are good, some days are shitty. I guess today is one of those days where you can't leave the toilet.

Life feels somewhat flat these days. It is probably a Sweden thing, but my todo lists are no longer todo lists anymore. It turned into whenever-you-feel-like-try-to-do-it-if-you-want-lists. :bored:

I hate the fact that Spotify doesn't auto correct ASAP to A$AP in 2023.

Sometimes, I wish there was a tutorial or a map for dealing with the loss of those who are still living. 

I should probably do more leetcode.

Recently, I met someone and I think I am growing very fond of her. Cute smile and great personality. But this long distance stuff sucks.

I wonder if Khuvsgul is blue because of all the blue sunken ZIL-130s at the bottom of the ocean.

I wish someone had warned me about Swedish summer lasting 2 weeks.

I should definitely do more leetcode. /s

I am not sure if "concerned" or "troubled in your thoughts" are the correct emotional response to your SO making plans to see each other and even offering to chip in for the plane ticket.

Childish Gambino - I. flight of the navigator has to be the most soul wrenching song ever made.

I do not want to forget about this post. https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/

I recently found out that there is pub called Maclaren in Berlin.

I wish tumblr blogs would make a return.

> just hold me my dear.
